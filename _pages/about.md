I am a physicist studying quantum computing in semiconductor qubits. I want to build a scalable quantum computer, using the tools of physics and machine learning. I am currently an NRC postdoc at NIST and UMD. I got my PhD in 2024 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by Mark Friesen and Susan Coppersmith.
